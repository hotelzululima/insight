The crackme has been originally written by Renaud Tabary, a former
member of the Insight team and improved by GÃ©rald Point. This tutorial
has been first presented at Dagstuhl seminar 14241, @emph{Challenges in
Analysing Executables: Scalability, Self-Modifying Code and Synergy} in
June 2014, at Dagstuhl Schloss, Germany. We would like to thanks all the
attenders for their precious feedback and comments on this tutorial, but
also all the people that sent us their feedback.
